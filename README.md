## Get started

Here's what you need to do to get this project running.

- Clone the repo
- Create a virtual environment with a command like: `python -m venv .venv`
- Activate the virtual environment with: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Install all of the dependencies with : `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Run the `bicycle_demand.ipynb` notebook

Now you should be able to run the project and DVC is already in place.

## Running experiments

All that's left is running experiments. To do that, open a terminal and run: `dvc exp run`
